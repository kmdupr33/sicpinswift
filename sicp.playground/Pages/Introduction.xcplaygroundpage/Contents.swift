 # Introduction:
 
 * callout(Exerpt): The acts of the mind, wherein it exerts its power over
 simple ideas, are chiefly these three: 1. Combining
 several simple ideas into one compound one, and thus all
 complex ideas are made. 2. The second is bringing two
 ideas, whether simple or complex, together, and setting
 them by one another so as to take a view of them at once,
 without uniting them into one, by which it gets all its
 ideas of relations. 3. The third is separating them from all
 other ideas that accompany them in their real existence:
 this is called abstraction, and thus all its general ideas are
 made.
 
 \- John Lock, *An Essay Concerning Human Understanding*
 
 Computational processes are abstract beings that inhabit computers. We can direct those beings to manipulate data by writing computer programs. Thus, computer programmers are, in a sense, like magicians. They conjure up spirits (processes) using incantations (computer programs).
 
 Because programs tend to be relatively contained, programmers don't need to fear the spirits they conjure as much as true magicians fear theirs. However, programming can still be scary. The writer of an air traffic controller program, for example, can cause plane crashes if he's not careful.
 
 Fortunately, programming languages do more than direct processes. They also give us a way to organize our ideas about the processes we are attempting to direct with the language. Every powerful language has three ways of doing this:
 
 * primitive expressions: the simplest things the language is concerned with
 * ways to build complex elements from simpler ones
 * ways to name and maniuplate complex elements as units
 
 Let's call these three tools the "methanisms of organization." These mechanisms of organization can be applied to the two aforementioned elements with which our processes are concerned: procedures and data. (We'll see later that these the distinction between these two elements is tenuous.)
 
 In the first chapter, we'll examine how the mechanisms of organization can be applied to procedures.
